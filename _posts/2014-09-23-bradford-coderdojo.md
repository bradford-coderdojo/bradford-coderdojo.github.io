We are pleased to announce the first date of the _Bradford CoderDojo_ to be held at the _Innovation Centre Bradford on Saturday the 25th October 09:30 to 12:30_.

CoderDojo is a global volunteer-led community of free programming clubs for young people. These young people, between 7 and 17, learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology. In addition to learning to code attendees meet like minded people and get to show off what they've been working on.

There is a focus on community, peer learning, youth mentoring and self led learning with an emphasis on openness, helping others and showing how coding is a force for change in the world.

Most importantly CoderDojo is about encouraging creativity and having fun with technology in a social environment. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.

We are working with other programming enthusiasts and experts across the Bradford area to run the Bradford CoderDojo; if you would like to get involved in the running of the Dojo please contact myself, Paul Scott on <bradford.uk@coderdojo.com>.

We will be finalising and opening up on-line registration for the forthcoming Dojo shortly.
