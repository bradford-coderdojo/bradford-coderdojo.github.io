Today we learnt to code conversation trees for npc and player actions using the new Fun64 [Chatdown](https://xriss.github.io/fun64/blog/2017-03-19-chatdown/) format.

During the session, we explored code structures, linking data together and creative writing.

*Check out [Ben's story](https://xriss.github.io/fun64/run/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fbradford-coderdojo%2Fbltm%2Fmaster%2Fteam%2Fben%2Fben.chatdown.fun.lua) online*

We made a new Team repository so we could have our own folders to work in - this also helps us organize our code and not accidentally edit other people's work. [Have a look](https://github.com/bradford-coderdojo/bltm/tree/master/team) and check out our stories!


This exercise will be included in our main game project, [BLTM](https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io/bltm/) - a platform game packed with tasty fun!
