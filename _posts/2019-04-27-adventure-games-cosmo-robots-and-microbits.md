Penny showed us how to code her Cosmo robot using Scratch.

Miles has been working on his game this morning and has now got it working really well.

Today we're also continuing last month's session on creating adventure games using the <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine engine</a> and spent some time learning scripts to make our stories interesting.
