It's been a snowy few weeks so it's great to be back for Coder Dojo today when the weather is clear.

*Learning how to create complex games using Curric Innovation Game 
Makerâ€™s toolkit*

*Going through the basics of server scripts*

We also learned about bash scripting using command line in a terminal 
to do stuff in a remote server. A bit advanced and a bit different but 
we are always looking to do new things.

If there is something you want to learn but not sure how, let us know 
and we'll figure it out together.

See you next month!
